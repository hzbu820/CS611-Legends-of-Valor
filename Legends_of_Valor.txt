CS 611 - Legends of Valor

In this assignment you will work in groups of two in order to implement an extension of
Legends: Monsters and Heroes called Legends of Valor.
This time the heroes battle monsters in a contest of strategy and skill. Take advantage of the
terrain, coordinate actions between heroes, and use items to outwit and outfight the invading
waves of monsters. Can your heroes destroy the monsters’ Nexus and stop the monster
invasion? Or will the monsters overrun your own fortress?
I. Overview
Legends of Valor is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena)-like game. The player will control
a team of 3 heroes who will attempt to fight their way through to the monsters’ Nexus. The
heroes win if any of them reach the monsters’ Nexus. The heroes lose if any monster reaches
the heroes’ Nexus.
Many aspects of Legends of Valor are carried over from Monsters and Heroes. Items, heroes,
and monsters are the same. The calculations for damage and armor remain the same.
Experience and gold are given on a per-monster basis, but the amounts per monster are the
same as before.
II. The World of Play
Legends of Valor is played in an 8x8 grid of spaces. The grid is divided in three lanes, each
separated by a column of impassible spaces. Each lane has a width of two spaces. Each space
can hold up to one monster and up to one hero. A space cannot hold two monsters or two
heroes.
The first two columns are the first (top) lane. The third column is a wall between the first and
the second lane. The fourth and the fifth columns are the second (middle) lane. The sixth
column is another wall. The seventh and eighth columns are the third (bottom) lane. The first
and the last row will represent a Nexus. The first row (at the top of the screen) is the monsters’
Nexus while the last row (at the bottom of the screen) is the heroes’ Nexus. See the layout
below:

Monsters’ Nexus
         
         
         
         
         
         
Heroes’ Nexus

Top Lane | Mid Lane | Bot Lane  
(Note: Lanes are separated by impassible spaces.)


Spaces differ between Legends of Valor and Monsters and Heroes. Legends of Valor introduces
spaces with terrain bonuses and new behaviors. The spaces used in Legends of Valor are:
• Nexus
• Inaccessible
• Obstacle
• Plain
• Bush
• Cave
• Koulou
Nexus. The spaces at the top and bottom of each lane are the Nexus spaces. Monsters and
heroes spawn at their respective Nexus. The heroes’ Nexus also serves as a market, where
heroes can buy and sell items. Reaching an opponent’s Nexus space ends the game.
Inaccessible. Heroes and monsters cannot enter these spaces.
Obstacle. Heroes and monsters cannot enter this space. However, a hero can use a turn to
remove the obstacle. When removed, the obstacle space becomes a plain space.
Plain. These spaces have no special attributes.
Bush. Bush spaces increase the dexterity of any hero inside them. The bonus is removed when
the hero leaves the space. For a more challenging game, monsters can also receive a bonus in
this space.
Cave. Cave spaces increase the agility of any hero inside them. The bonus is removed when the
hero leaves the space. For a more challenging game, monsters can receive a dodge bonus in
this space.
Koulou. Koulou spaces increase the strength of any hero who is inside them. The bonus is
removed when the hero leaves the space. For a more challenging game, monsters can receive
an attack bonus in this space.
The obstacles, plain, bush, cave, and koulou spaces are randomly distributed in the lanes. This
does not change the placement of Nexus and Inaccessible cells, which should exist as described
above. You are encouraged to experiment with any type distribution you find that makes the
game interesting as long as:
• the board has special spaces of each type,
• the board is not entirely special spaces, and
• the distribution is random.


III. Gameplay
The game is played by two teams: a team of 3 heroes and a team of monsters. The player will
control the hero team. The game itself will control the monsters.
The goal of each team is to have one of their members reach the Nexus of the other team.
Before the game begins, the player chooses the three heroes that will be used and which of the
three lanes that hero will start in. At the start of the game the heroes spawn in their Nexus and
three equally-leveled monsters spawn in their Nexus. The Nexus space that a hero spawns in is
specific to that hero, and that relationship is maintained for the whole game.
The game is played in rounds. A round consists of the heroes’ turn followed by the monsters’
turn. During the heroes’ turn, the player must perform one valid action for each of the heroes.
Once all of the heroes have made their move, their turn is over. Then it becomes the monsters’
turn. During the monster’s turn each monster either attacks a hero (if they meet the conditions
to attack) or moves one space “forward” (towards the heroes’ Nexus). Once all of the monsters
on the board have acted, the round is over and a new round begins.
The following are actions which can be taken by a hero in Legends of Valor:
• Change Weapon or Armor
• Use a Potion
• Attack
• Cast a Spell
• Move
• Teleport
• Recall
Change weapon or armor. This action functions identically to the equip weapon or armor
action in Monsters and Heroes: A hero will equip the selected weapon or armor piece and end
their turn.
Use a Potion. This action functions identically to the use a potion action in Monsters and
Heroes: A hero will consume the potion and receive its effects. Then that hero’s turn ends.
Attack. The attack move’s damage is calculated the same as in Monsters and Heroes. However,
we must now consider whether an enemy is within range to attack. The attack range is limited
to the current space and its neighbors (see diagram for the mid lane below).

Inaccessible  | Out-of-range | Out-of-range | Inaccessible
Inaccessible  | In-range     | In-range     | Inaccessible
Inaccessible  | In-range     | Current      | Inaccessible
Inaccessible  | In-range     | In-range     | Inaccessible
Inaccessible  | Out-of-range | Out-of-range | Inaccessible


A hero can only attack one monster per turn, even if multiple are in range. The same applies for
monsters.
Cast a Spell. The spell damage and effect are the same as in Monsters and Heroes. The range
limitation for the attack move also applies for spell moves in Legends of Valor.
Move. The move action allows a hero or a monster to move north, west, south, or east. There is
no diagonal movement. Each hero or monster moves separately from the others. Legends of
Valor adds additional rules that a hero cannot move behind a monster without killing it and a
hero cannot move into a space already occupied by another hero. See diagram below
demonstrating different scenarios for the hero’s move in the top lane:

Monster | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Legal move | Inaccessible
Legal move | Hero | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Legal move | Inaccessible


Inaccessible | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Monster | Legal move
Inaccessible | Illegal move | Illegal move | Inaccessible
Legal move | Hero | Inaccessible
Legal move | Monster | Hero | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Legal move | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Legal move | Inaccessible



Illegal move | Monster | Legal move
Inaccessible | Illegal move | Hero | Illegal Move | Inaccessible
Hero | Illegal move | Hero | Inaccessible
Legal Move | Hero | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Legal move | Inaccessible
Illegal move | Legal move | Inaccessible


This rule also applies for monsters. Thus, by skillful placement, a hero may block a monster
from reaching the Nexus until that hero is killed.
Teleport. A teleport action allows a hero to move to a space adjacent to a target hero in a
different lane. Teleport works only between different lanes, so a hero cannot teleport from one
space in a lane to another space in the same lane. A hero may not teleport to a space ahead of
the hero being teleported to, onto a space already occupied by another hero, and not behind a
monster in the lane. See the diagram below, where a hero in the top lane is teleporting to a
hero in the bottom lane:

Inaccessible | Illegal move | Illegal move
Inaccessible | Target Hero | Legal move
Inaccessible | Legal move | Illegal move

Inaccessible | Illegal move | Illegal move
Inaccessible | Target Hero | Monster | Legal move
Inaccessible | Legal move | Illegal move

Inaccessible | Illegal move | Illegal move
Inaccessible | Target Hero | Hero | Illegal move
Inaccessible | Legal move | Illegal move



Recall. The recall action allows a hero to return to their specific Nexus. This will always return
the hero to the Nexus space they spawned at—no matter how far they are from that Nexus
space (i.e. even if the hero is in another lane).
You may add a “pass turn” action if you feel it improves gameplay.
Heroes and monsters make one valid move per turn. Buying and selling do not count as actions
so a hero can, for example, buy two items, sell one, and then make a move in a single turn.
Similar to Monsters and Heroes, at the end of every round every hero that is still alive regains
10% of their hp and 10% of their mana. When a hero dies, they respawn in their specific Nexus
space at the start of the next round.
Every few rounds, three new monsters will spawn in the monsters’ Nexus, one for each lane.
You can implement a game difficulty that specifies how frequently a new monster is spawned
(for example, easy: new spawn every 6 rounds, medium: every 4 rounds, hard: every 2 rounds).
Therefore, at any given time, each lane can contain multiple monsters if the hero does not kill
the current monster before the next one spawns!



IV. Examples and Suggestions
• The board is composed of 20% of each special space type (Bush, Cave, and Koulou) and
40% Plain spaces
• The special spaces increase the hero’s stat by 10% (i.e. A Bush space increases a hero’s
dexterity by 10%)
• Monsters drop 500 × monster_level gold when killed, given to all heroes
• Monsters give 2 ∗ monster_level experience points when killed, given to all heroes
• Monsters do not receive terrain bonuses
• Heroes spawn in the left space of their lane’s Nexus
• Monsters spawn in the right space of their lane’s Nexus
• Monsters attack if any hero is within attack range
• Monsters only move down (south)
• New monsters spawn every 8 rounds
• New monsters have a level equal to highest level among the 3 heroes
• Heroes respawn with full HP and full MP and lose no gold for dying
• Victory for a team happens immediately upon entry of any enemy Nexus space by a
team member

The three heroes are represented as H1, H2, and H3. The monsters are correspondingly M1,
M2, and M3. Note that both a hero and a monster can occupy a space together. Your interface
should be able to represent the same. The space types are denoted by:
• N – Nexus
• I – Impassible
• P – Plain
• C – Cave
• B – Bush
• K – Koulou



There are three main goals to this assignment:
1. Gain experience effectively developing software in a team.
2. Learn to analyze structures and learn from programs that are not your own.
3. Learn how to develop reusable code and how to actually reuse existing codebases.
In order to have as effective communication as possible (which will likely prove useful in your
future), for this assignment we strongly suggest the use of git and Slack. There will be a quick
demo of both tools by the TA and, further assistance in their basic usage can be offered in office
hours.
You may continue to use the helper files that were provided for the previous assignment.
However, they are helper files, not testing files. Their role is to help you understand
approximately what each instance should look like from a logistics perspective. They are neither
tested thoroughly nor formally proven absolutely correct. You are free to change their values as
you see fit in order to create a more meaningful gaming experience.
